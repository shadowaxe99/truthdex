# Analytics Dashboard Guidelines

The analytics dashboard for the influencer-brand collaborations platform provides a comprehensive view of key performance metrics. Here are some guidelines and best practices for interpreting and analyzing the data presented on the dashboard:

1. **Engagement Rate**: The engagement rate measures the level of interaction and engagement with the content. It is calculated by dividing the total number of engagements (likes, comments, shares) by the total number of impressions and multiplying by 100.

2. **Conversion Rate**: The conversion rate measures the percentage of users who take a desired action, such as making a purchase or signing up for a newsletter. It is calculated by dividing the total number of conversions by the total number of visitors and multiplying by 100.

3. **Revenue Generated**: The revenue generated metric tracks the total amount of revenue generated from influencer-brand collaborations. It includes the revenue from product sales, affiliate marketing, and sponsored content.

4. **Data Sources**: The analytics dashboard retrieves the necessary data from the Firestore database using the appropriate queries and API calls. The data sources include user profiles, collaboration details, engagement metrics, conversion data, and revenue information.

5. **Visualization Techniques**: The data is visualized using charts, graphs, and other suitable visualization techniques. Line charts can be used to track the trend of engagement rate and conversion rate over time. Bar charts can be used to compare revenue generated by different influencers or brands. Pie charts can be used to show the distribution of engagement metrics.

6. **Responsive Design**: The analytics dashboard is designed to be responsive and compatible with different screen sizes and devices. It should adapt to the available screen space and provide an optimal viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

7. **Interactive Features**: The analytics dashboard includes interactive features to enhance the user experience. Users can filter the data based on specific influencers, brands, or time periods. They can also sort the data based on different metrics or drill down into specific collaboration details for more in-depth analysis.

8. **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests are written to validate the functionality and accuracy of the analytics dashboard. The tests cover different scenarios and edge cases to ensure that the calculations and visualizations are correct.
