# Analytics Dashboard

This project is responsible for developing the analytics dashboard for the influencer-brand collaborations platform. The analytics dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key performance metrics, allowing users to track and analyze their performance in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner.

## Features

- Display key performance metrics such as engagement rate, conversion rate, and revenue generated.
- Implement interactive features like filtering, sorting, and drill-down capabilities.
- Retrieve necessary data from the Firestore database using appropriate queries and API calls.
- Process and transform data to calculate required performance metrics.
- Visualize data using charts, graphs, or other suitable visualization techniques.
- Ensure the analytics dashboard is responsive and compatible with different screen sizes and devices.
- Write comprehensive unit tests to validate functionality and accuracy.
- Collaborate with the backend team to ensure availability of necessary data and APIs.
- Update documentation and comments in the code to reflect changes and provide clear explanations of the analytics dashboard logic.
