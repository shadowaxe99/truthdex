# User Interface

The user interface of the TrustIndex platform is designed with a focus on ease of use and accessibility. It is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Bootstrap, a widely-used CSS framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.

## UI/UX Design

The design of the user interface is user-centric, aiming to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience. The design process involves the following steps:

1. **Identifying User Needs:** Understanding the needs and expectations of the users by conducting user research and interviews.
2. **Wireframing:** Creating wireframes to outline the structure and layout of the user interface.
3. **Prototyping:** Developing interactive prototypes to visualize the user interface and gather user feedback.
4. **Usability Testing:** Conducting usability tests to identify any issues or areas of improvement in the user interface.

The design of the user interface is implemented in the `ui_design/design.js` file.

## Accessibility

The TrustIndex platform is committed to ensuring that its user interface is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. The platform complies with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), a set of guidelines developed to ensure that web content is accessible to people with disabilities.

The accessibility features of the user interface include:

1. **Text Alternatives:** Providing text alternatives for non-text content.
2. **Keyboard Accessibility:** Ensuring that all functionality is accessible through a keyboard.
3. **Readable Text:** Using sufficient contrast ratios for text and background colors to ensure readability.
4. **Navigable Content:** Providing ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.

The accessibility features of the user interface are implemented in the `ui_design/accessibility.js` file.
