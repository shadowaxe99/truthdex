# Evaluation Metrics and Performance Indicators

This document outlines the key performance indicators (KPIs) and user feedback mechanisms that will be used to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the TrustIndex platform.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The following KPIs will be used to measure the success and performance of the TrustIndex platform:

1. **User Engagement:** This will be measured by tracking active users, session duration, and user interactions with the platform.

3. **System Performance:** System performance will be monitored using tools like Prometheus and Grafana. Key metrics will include server response time, database query time, and system uptime.

## User Feedback

User feedback is crucial for the continuous improvement of the TrustIndex platform. The following mechanisms will be implemented to collect and analyze user feedback:

1. **User Surveys:** Periodic surveys will be conducted to gather user feedback on various aspects of the platform, including its usability, features, and trust score accuracy.

2. **Feedback Form:** A feedback form will be available on the platform for users to provide their comments and suggestions at any time.

3. **User Interviews:** Regular user interviews will be conducted to gain deeper insights into user experiences and needs.

4. **Usability Testing:** Usability tests will be conducted to identify any issues or barriers that users may face when using the platform.

The feedback collected through these mechanisms will be analyzed and used to inform future improvements and enhancements to the TrustIndex platform.
