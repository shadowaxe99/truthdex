# Testing, Quality Assurance, and Deployment

## Testing Frameworks

### Unit Testing

We utilize Jest as our primary testing framework for unit testing. The tests are located in the `testing/unit_tests.js` file. Each function in our application has a corresponding test to ensure it behaves as expected.

### Integration Testing

Integration tests are developed to ensure that the system components work together as expected. These tests are located in the `testing/integration_tests.js` file. They simulate user interactions and check the overall flow of the application.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

### Pipeline Setup

We have set up CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins. The configuration for this pipeline is located in the `deployment/CI_CD.js` file. This pipeline automates the process of testing and deploying our application, ensuring that the code in the main branch is always deployable.

## Monitoring and Logging

### Monitoring Tools

We use Prometheus and Grafana to track system performance. These tools provide us with real-time metrics about our application, such as response times and system load. The configuration for these tools is located in the `deployment/monitoring.js` file.

### Logging

We utilize a logging framework to capture and analyze system logs for debugging and performance tuning. The configuration for logging is located in the `deployment/logging.js` file. These logs help us identify and fix issues in our application.
