# TrustIndex Platform Features

This document outlines the key features of the TrustIndex platform.

## Profile Creation

The TrustIndex platform allows individuals and entities to create and manage profiles. These profiles contain fields for basic information, linked accounts, and public stances. The creation and management of profiles are handled by the `createProfile()` function in the `backend/controllers.js` file.

## Public Stance Indexing

The platform indexes public stances using web scraping and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The `scrapeData()` function in the `data_scraping/scraping.js` file is used for web scraping, while the `indexPublicStance()` function in the `backend/controllers.js` file employs NLP techniques to categorize and summarize public stances.

## Trust Metrics

TrustIndex calculates trust scores based on public stances, past actions, and peer reviews. The algorithm for this calculation is developed in the `backend/controllers.js` file.

## Search and Filter

The platform provides efficient, scalable search capabilities using Elasticsearch. It also allows results to be filtered based on various criteria. These features are implemented in the `frontend/components/Search.js` and `frontend/components/Filter.js` files respectively.

## Privacy Controls

TrustIndex implements end-to-end encryption for sensitive user data and ensures compliance with GDPR and other relevant data privacy regulations. These privacy controls are implemented in the `backend/authentication.js` and `backend/authorization.js` files.

## Reporting and Moderation

The platform includes a system for users to report false information or inappropriate content. It also has a moderation queue for handling reported content. These features are implemented in the `frontend/components/Reporting.js` file.

## Data Scraping

TrustIndex keeps its data up-to-date through scheduled scraping tasks. These tasks are developed in the `data_scraping/scheduling.js` file.

## Data Verification

The platform implements a community verification system to validate manually entered data. This system is implemented in the `data_verification/verification.js` file.

## Data Privacy

TrustIndex uses data anonymization techniques to protect user privacy. These techniques are implemented in the `data_privacy/anonymization.js` file.

## UI/UX Design

The platform's user interface is designed with a focus on ease of use and accessibility. The design is implemented in the `ui_design/design.js` file.

## Accessibility

TrustIndex ensures compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). This compliance is ensured in the `ui_design/accessibility.js` file.

## Testing, Quality Assurance, and Deployment

The platform uses Jest for unit testing and develops integration tests to ensure system components work together as expected. These tests are implemented in the `testing/unit_tests.js` and `testing/integration_tests.js` files respectively. The platform also sets up CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins or CircleCI, implemented in the `deployment/CI_CD.js` file.

## Monitoring and Logging

TrustIndex uses monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track system performance. It also utilizes logging frameworks to capture and analyze system logs for debugging and performance tuning. These features are implemented in the `deployment/monitoring.js` and `deployment/logging.js` files respectively.

## Project Management

The platform employs Agile methodologies for iterative development and feedback. This methodology is implemented in the `project_management/agile.js` file.

## Resource Allocation

TrustIndex details the distribution of human and financial resources across various project phases in the `project_management/resource_allocation.js` file.

## Budget Estimation

The platform provides a detailed budget estimation covering all phases of development. This estimation is provided in the `project_management/budget_estimation.js` file.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

TrustIndex identifies potential technical bottlenecks and develops mitigation strategies. It also assesses legal risks concerning data privacy and intellectual property. These assessments and strategies are implemented in the `risk_assessment/technical_risks.js` and `risk_assessment/legal_compliance.js` files respectively.

## Evaluation Metrics and Performance Indicators

The platform defines KPIs like user engagement, trust score accuracy, and system performance. It also implements mechanisms for collecting and analyzing user feedback for continuous improvement. These features are implemented in the `evaluation/KPIs.js` and `evaluation/user_feedback.js` files respectively.
