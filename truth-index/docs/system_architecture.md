# System Architecture

This document outlines the system architecture for the TrustIndex platform. The platform is designed to be robust, scalable, and secure, allowing stakeholders to gauge the trustworthiness of individuals and entities in the startup and venture capital realm.

## Backend Development

The backend of the TrustIndex platform is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

- **Node.js:** This is the runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side. It's used to build the server for the TrustIndex platform.
- **Express.js:** This is a web application framework for Node.js. It's used to handle network requests (HTTP requests) and to build the RESTful APIs for the TrustIndex platform.
- **MongoDB:** This is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. It's used to store data for the TrustIndex platform.

The backend code can be found in the `backend` directory, with the main server code in `server.js`, routes in `routes.js`, controllers in `controllers.js`, models in `models.js`, and database connection in `database.js`.

## Frontend Development

The frontend of the TrustIndex platform is built using React.js and Bootstrap.

- **React.js:** This is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's used to build the UI for the TrustIndex platform.
- **Bootstrap:** This is a free and open-source CSS framework for responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It's used to ensure the UI is responsive across various devices.

The frontend code can be found in the `frontend` directory, with the main application code in `App.js` and various components in the `components` directory.

## Database Design

The database for the TrustIndex platform is designed with schemas for user profiles, public stances, reviews, and ratings. Efficient indexing is implemented to ensure optimal search and retrieval performance.

The database schemas can be found in `models.js` in the `backend` directory.

## Authentication & Authorization

The TrustIndex platform implements OAuth 2.0 for secure authorization from external services and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure, token-based user authentication.

The authentication and authorization code can be found in `authentication.js` and `authorization.js` in the `backend` directory.
