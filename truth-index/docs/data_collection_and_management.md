# Data Collection and Management

This document outlines the strategies and techniques used in the data collection and management for the TrustIndex platform.

## Data Scraping

Data scraping is performed using a combination of libraries such as BeautifulSoup or Scrapy. The `scrapeData()` function in `data_scraping/scraping.js` is responsible for this task. It is scheduled to run at regular intervals to keep the data up-to-date. The scheduling is handled by the `scheduling.js` file in the same directory.

## Data Verification

To ensure the accuracy of manually entered data, a community verification system is implemented. The `verifyData()` function in `data_verification/verification.js` handles this task. It allows users to validate the information entered by others, contributing to the overall trustworthiness of the platform.

## Data Privacy

Data privacy is a top priority for TrustIndex. To protect user privacy, data anonymization techniques are implemented. The `anonymizeData()` function in `data_privacy/anonymization.js` is responsible for this task. It ensures that personally identifiable information is not directly stored in the database, helping to maintain user privacy and comply with data protection regulations.

In conclusion, the data collection and management for TrustIndex is designed to be robust, secure, and privacy-focused. It ensures that the platform has access to up-to-date and accurate data, while also protecting the privacy of its users.
